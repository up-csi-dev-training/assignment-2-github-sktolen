"Today Is Gonna Be a Great Day"

by Bowling for Soup

There's a hundred and four days of summer vacation
Then school comes along just to end it
So the annual problem for our generation
Is finding a good way to spend it

Like maybe...
Building a rocket
Or fighting a mummy
Or climbing up the Eiffel Tower

Discovering something that doesn't exist
Phineas: Hey!
or giving a monkey a shower
Surfing tidal waves
Creating nanobots
Or locating Frankenstein's brain
Phineas: It's over here!

Finding a dodo bird
Painting a continent
Or driving our sister insane

As you can see,
There's a whole lot of stuff to do before school starts this fall
Phineas: Come on Perry!
So stick with us
'Cause Phineas and Ferb are gonna do it all!
So stick with us
'Cause Phineas and Ferb are gonna do it all!
